        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and other relevant details when you create an account on MCR. Additionally, we may collect non-personal information, including but not limited to, your IP address and browsing preferences.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to provide and improve the MCR platform, customize your experience, communicate with you, and enforce our terms and policies. We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for commercial purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

        <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>MCR uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience. Cookies are small files stored on your device that help us analyze usage patterns and improve our services. You can choose to disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may affect certain features of the platform.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>MCR may use third-party services, such as analytics tools, to better understand user behavior and improve our platform.

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, no online platform can guarantee absolute security, and users should also take steps to protect their information, such as using strong passwords and keeping login credentials confidential.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>MCR is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us to have it promptly removed.</p>

Continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. Users are expected to use an actively-monitored email when signing up to ensure they are notified of changes.</p>

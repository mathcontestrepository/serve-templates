      <h2>Our Team</h2>
	<p>The MCR was launched in October 2023 by some grade 11 students at Garth Webb Secondary School. The initial edition of the MCR simply scraped problems and answers from various websites and mapped them together in a database. Users could then check if their answers were correct by typing in a number. This is still the core functionality of the MCR today, but our team has built on this by including a real-time grading feature by pulling answers from websites when the user submits for some problems (meaning we don't need to store answers). Now we host weekly challenges and large online contests open to all users. We boast nearly 1400 public math problems, of which over 1200 were scraped from the web. We've also hosted 7 of our own contests, some of which have been saved <a href="https://mathcontestrepository.pythonanywhere.com/contests">here</a>.</p>
